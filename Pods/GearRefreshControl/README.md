A custom animation for the UIRefreshControl. Inspired by this [Dribble shot](https://dribbble.com/shots/1974767-gear-powered-pull-to-refresh-animation?list=animated&sort=popular&timeframe=now&offset=19) and [this tutorial](http://www.jackrabbitmobile.com/design/ios-custom-pull-to-refresh-control/).

# Usage
Install through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org)

```
pod 'GearRefreshControl', '~> 1.0.0'

use_frameworks!
```

Setup your `refreshControl`:

```swift
override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    gearRefreshControl = GearRefreshControl(frame: self.view.bounds)
    gearRefreshControl.addTarget(self, action: #selector(ViewController.refresh), for: UIControlEvents.valueChanged)
    self.refreshControl = gearRefreshControl
}
```

Update state:

```swift
override func scrollViewDidScroll(_ scrollView: UIScrollView) {
    gearRefreshControl.scrollViewDidScroll(scrollView)
}
```

Stop the animation on completion:
```swift
self.gearRefreshControl.endRefreshing()
```

## Customization

You can customize the color of the control by setting the `gearTintColor` property:

```swift
gearRefreshControl.gearTintColor = .red
```

Checkout the sample project for the full implementation.
